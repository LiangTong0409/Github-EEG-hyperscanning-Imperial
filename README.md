# EEG-hyperscanning-Imperial
EEG hyperscanning study


don't forget to download the Matlab toolbox before run the code, they are commented in 'EEG_Preprocess'

todo list
1. Please start with the 'EEG3 matrix plot', only re-plot the IBS part with interested channels/areas mentioned in the report.
    re-compare solo vs passive/Hand/Vision; Solo vs partner conditions; HP vs TG vs RP;

2. Please calculate entropy (Fuzz, Samp, Ap) for all channels (maybe need one week, could do Fuzzy first)
   then re-compare again using entropy

3. compare the performance of different entropy method
